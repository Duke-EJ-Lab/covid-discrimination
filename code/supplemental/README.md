## Supplemental Code

This folder should include any code that isn't necessary for replication assuming someone has the basic cleaned main data. Files that might end up here include: 

* Files that do basic cleaning to a dataset (non specific to this project), that the lab uses as a basis. 
* Sensitivity analysis that is not a main analysis, but referenced in the main paper and should be replicable. 
* Code that generates descriptive stats referenced in the paper. 
* Code that extracts tables referenced in the paper
